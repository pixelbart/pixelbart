Hey there! I'm Kevin, a remote web developer at JurCase GmbH, specializing in PHP, JavaScript, WordPress, and Codeigniter. I also freelance as Pixelbart, where I focus on WordPress maintenance. I'm passionate about gaming, happily married since 2015, and have a keen interest in Germanic Religious Studies. Cheers!
